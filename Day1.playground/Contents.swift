import Cocoa

var str = "Hello, playground"

str = "goodbye!"

//take notes on the computr is fine as well. dont need to be on paper.

//here is an example of what string are;
let taylor = "swift"
//there can only be one value that can't be changed again.

//here is an example of what a variable looks like;
str = "Hello, playground"
//theres more than one variable, and can be changed.

var age = 38

//option+click on a variable or constant will tell you the datatype.

//this is an example of a double.
var pi = 3.141

var awesome = true //this is a bool?

//today i learned about string interpolation the ability to place variables inside your strings to make them more useful.
//this is an example;

var score = 85
var str = "Your score was \(score)"
//making string out of srings are like
var results = "The test results are here: \(str)"
